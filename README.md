# stb_avif

A small, single-header **C89 AVIF decoder** with a built-in scalar AV1
decoder.

This project is inspired by the design philosophy of the
[stb](https://github.com/nothings/stb) libraries: keep the decoder
self-contained, portable, and easy to integrate into applications that
need AVIF image decoding without a large codec framework.

The project is currently **work in progress**. The built-in AV1 decoder
is being developed incrementally against real-world AVIF samples and is
not yet a drop-in replacement for mature AV1 decoders.

## Features

### AVIF / ISOBMFF

The AVIF layer currently handles the parts of the HEIF/ISOBMFF container
needed by the test corpus, including:

-   `ftyp`
-   `meta`
-   `iloc`
-   `iinf`
-   `iprp`
-   `ipco`
-   `ipma`
-   `ispe`
-   `pixi`
-   `colr`
-   `av1C`
-   AV1 image items and auxiliary alpha items
-   Multiple AV1 tile groups
-   Multi-tile AVIF images
-   Auxiliary alpha images

The decoder ultimately returns ordinary RGB/RGBA pixels through the
public API.

### AV1

The built-in scalar decoder is split into small headers covering
individual parts of AV1:

-   OBU parsing
-   Sequence headers
-   Frame headers
-   Tile parsing and decoding
-   Partition decoding
-   Intra prediction
-   Transform decoding and inverse transforms
-   Quantization/dequantization
-   Coefficient decoding
-   MSAC entropy decoding
-   CDF tables
-   Deblocking
-   CDEF
-   Loop restoration
-   Palette modes
-   Segmentation support
-   8/10/12-bit sample handling
-   4:2:0, 4:2:2 and 4:4:4 pixel formats

The decoder uses a 64-bit unsigned integer type where required:

``` c
#if defined(_MSC_VER)
    typedef unsigned __int64 stbv_u64;
#else
    typedef unsigned long long stbv_u64;
#endif
```

This is intentional: some AV1 arithmetic cannot be implemented safely
using only 32-bit integers.

## Public API

The main interface is in `stb_avif.h`.

``` c
unsigned char *stb_avif_load_from_memory(
    const unsigned char *data,
    int len,
    int *x,
    int *y,
    int *channels,
    int req_channels);
```

Free the returned image with:

``` c
void stb_avif_free(void *ptr);
```

The last error can be obtained with:

``` c
const char *stb_avif_failure_reason(void);
```

### Basic usage

Put `stb_avif.h` in your project and define `STB_AVIF_IMPLEMENTATION` in
exactly one C source file:

``` c
#define STB_AVIF_IMPLEMENTATION
#include "stb_avif.h"
```

Then:

``` c
int x, y, channels;
unsigned char *pixels;

pixels = stb_avif_load_from_memory(
    data, data_size,
    &x, &y, &channels,
    4);

if (!pixels) {
    printf("AVIF decode failed: %s\n",
           stb_avif_failure_reason());
    return 1;
}

/* Use pixels here. */

stb_avif_free(pixels);
```

`req_channels` may be:

-   `0` --- use the image's natural channel count
-   `3` --- RGB
-   `4` --- RGBA

## Optional dav1d backend

For comparison and for applications that require a mature AV1 decoder,
the project can use [dav1d](https://code.videolan.org/videolan/dav1d)
instead of the built-in scalar AV1 decoder.

Define:

``` c
#define STB_AVIF_USE_DAV1D
#define STB_AVIF_IMPLEMENTATION
#include "stb_avif.h"
```

and link with dav1d:

``` sh
cc test.c -ldav1d
```

The dav1d backend is particularly useful when validating the built-in
decoder: the same AVIF file can be decoded through both implementations
and the resulting pixels compared.

## Test program

`test_avif2pnm.c` is a simple test driver which:

1.  Reads an AVIF file.
2.  Decodes it through `stb_avif`.
3.  Writes a PPM/PGM image.
4.  Writes a sidecar PGM when an alpha plane is available.

Build it with a C89 compiler:

``` sh
cc -std=c89 -o test_avif2pnm test_avif2pnm.c -lm
```

Run it on individual files:

``` sh
./test_avif2pnm image.avif
```

or use the built-in test list:

``` sh
./test_avif2pnm
```

On Windows, the same source can be built with a C compiler supporting
the required C89 features.

## Test corpus

The development tree currently contains a collection of AVIF files
covering different AV1 configurations, including:

-   8-bit 4:2:0
-   10-bit 4:2:0
-   8-bit 4:4:4
-   10-bit 4:4:4
-   10-bit 4:2:2
-   12-bit samples
-   monochrome images
-   palette-coded images
-   multi-tile images
-   images with auxiliary alpha
-   images using CDEF and loop restoration

Some particularly useful regression samples are:

``` text
kimono.avif
steam_2253100.avif
app-icon.avif
G-0trmKXsAA1sQZ.avif
avif-yuv444p.avif
avif-yuv444p10le.avif
fox.profile1.10bpc.yuv444.avif
```

These are intentionally kept as part of the development/test corpus
because they exercise different AV1 features.

## Current development status

The built-in decoder is **not yet fully conformant** with AV1.

Recent development has concentrated on:

-   multi-tile decoding
-   tile-local entropy/context state
-   AVIF `ipma` association handling
-   segment ID handling
-   CDEF
-   loop restoration
-   10-bit 4:4:4 decoding
-   palette decoding
-   chroma prediction and edge handling
-   right-edge reconstruction
-   comparison against dav1d/FFmpeg output

Several difficult samples now decode substantially correctly, but there
are still samples where the scalar decoder produces incorrect colors or
becomes desynchronized.

In particular, `avif-yuv444p10le.avif` is currently useful for debugging
multi-tile/high-bit-depth decoding: tile 0 can be visually reasonable
while other tiles still show incorrect colors.

Do **not** assume that successful decoding of one AVIF sample means that
all AV1 coding tools are implemented correctly.

## Design goals

The main goals of the project are:

-   Single-header public API
-   C89-compatible implementation
-   No mandatory external codec dependency
-   Small, understandable source files
-   Scalar C implementation
-   Reuse of well-understood AV1/dav1d algorithms where practical
-   Ability to compare the internal decoder against dav1d
-   Support for real-world AVIF images rather than only minimal
    conformance samples

The AV1 implementation is deliberately split into multiple internal
headers so individual codec components can be developed and tested
without turning `stb_avif.h` into an unmaintainable monolithic
implementation.

## Contributing / debugging

When adding or fixing AV1 functionality, it is useful to compare the
scalar decoder with dav1d using the same AVIF input.

When reporting a decoding problem, please include:

-   the AVIF sample
-   image dimensions
-   bit depth
-   chroma format
-   whether the image uses multiple tiles
-   whether an auxiliary alpha item is present
-   the generated output
-   whether `STB_AVIF_USE_DAV1D` produces the expected output

Small, feature-specific regression samples are especially valuable
because AV1 syntax errors often desynchronize the entropy decoder
several symbols before the visible corruption appears.
